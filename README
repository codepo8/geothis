Geo This! is an extension for Google Chrome that turns web sites into Maps by analysing the content. If you highlight a piece of text first only that one gets analysed.

You can see it in action at http://icant.co.uk/geothis

Geo This uses YQL, Yahoo Placemaker and the Google Static Maps API. 

The icons were created by Mihaiciuc Bogdan and badly resized by me.
